### Overview

The VueStacks calendar demo utilizes general Vue.js + Firebase CRUD functions to enable creating, updating, and deleting of events in a modified Vuetify calendar component (see the following to learn more about Vuetify calendars: https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/calendars). 

See full component in ```components/Calendar.vue```

### Addition Dependencies

This demo uses ```vue-textarea-autosize``` as a dependency. See the following for installation instructions: https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-textarea-autosize

### Setting Up Firebase

1. Set up a new project in Firebase with Database enabled.
2. Implement the following Firebase SDK scripts in main.js:

```
import firebase from "firebase";
firebase.initializeApp({
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  databaseURL: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: "",
  appId: ""
});

export const db = firebase.firestore();
```
